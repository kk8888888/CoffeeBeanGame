Welcome to **Coffee Cup Shooter 3D**, a fast-paced and addictive browser-based game where your mission is to shoot flying coffee cups using a high-powered coffee bean cannon! Test your reflexes and aim in a vibrant 3D world.

 *(You can replace this with a real screenshot of your game)*

## 🎮 How to Play

The objective is simple: shoot as many coffee cups as you can before time runs out to achieve the highest score.

*   **Aim:** Move your `Mouse` to aim the coffee bean shooter.
*   **Shoot:** Click the `Left Mouse Button (LMB)` to fire a coffee bean.
*   **Pause:** Press the `P` key to pause the game.

Keep an eye on your **streak**! Hitting multiple cups in a row without missing will increase your streak counter. If a cup falls to the ground, your streak resets to zero.

## 🏆 Scoring

Different colored cups are worth different points. Aim for the more valuable and faster cups to maximize your score!

| Cup Color | Points | Rarity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🟥 Red | 10 Points | Common |
| 🟦 Blue | 20 Points | Uncommon |
| 🟩 Green | 30 Points | Rare |
| 🎨 Multi-Color | 50 Points | Very Rare |
